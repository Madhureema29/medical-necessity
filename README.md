# NCDs and LCDs

This repository will continue to evolve. We are actively developing various coverage determinations. This repository contains CQL files for prepopulation of questionnaire and also the rules to extract data from FHIR server, data requirements, questionnaires in the form of resources, libraries, associated valuesets, 

You can find CQL logic for decision making too.

We are looking for active contributors, verifiers and testers for this effort.

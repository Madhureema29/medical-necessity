# Medical Necessity determination.

This repository will continue to evolve. We are actively developing various coverage determinations. This repository contains CQL files for prepopulation of questionnaire and also the rules to extract data from FHIR server, data requirements, questionnaires in the form of resources, libraries, associated valuesets,
